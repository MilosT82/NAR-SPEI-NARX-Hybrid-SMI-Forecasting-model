## Python Program for NAR-SPEI-SPEI Hybrid SMI Forecasting model
The Soil Moisture Index (SMI) may be predicted using high-frequency hydroclimatic measurements and this Python program's hybrid NAR and NARX architecture. The methodology includes univariate nonlinear precipitation and temperature forecasting, transformation into a standardized hydroclimatic index representing accumulated water balance, and hybrid nonlinear state evolution modeling of soil moisture anomalies using feedback and exogenous forcing. A rigorous chronological validation methodology guarantees out-of-sample integrity. Formalized NARX design attributes include universal approximation guarantees for finite-memory dynamical systems. Sensitivity study evaluates resilience to lag order, accumulation window length, and neural network capacity. The framework is robust, computationally tractable, and operationally replicable.


## Input datasets

The Excel table includes columns detailing measurements from a meteorological station situated near Novi Sad, Serbia. This weather station features an extensive array of sensors. The sensors quantify six features, which correspond to variables in an Excel data frame: SM (soil moisture), T (air temperature) and P (precipitation). The Excel spreadsheet is excluded from this repository due to data protection considerations.


## Dependencies

For running program the following packages are required:
- [pandas]
- [numpy]
- [matplotlib]
- [sklearn]
